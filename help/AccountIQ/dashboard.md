# 仪表板 {#dashboard}

仪表板汇总和汇总一组图表和报表中的数据，这些图表和报告旨在全面概述帐户共享的范围和影响。 它提供一个页面，其中包含来自帐户IQ的主要报表和量度。

## 平均共享分数 — 针对当前区段汇总 {#aggregated-sharing}

“汇总共享分数”面板提供顶行读数，以总结帐户和流数量方面的共享数量和影响。

这些值可帮助您了解订阅者共享凭据的规模，从而提供对其采取操作的必要性度量。

![](assets/aggregate-sharing-score.png)


*图：平均共享得分面板 — 针对当前区段汇总*

以下三个指标是平均共享分数的组成部分。

### 共享级别 {#sharing-level}

共享级别量规显示所选时间范围内共享的所有订阅者帐户（在定义的区段中）的百分比。

根据所选MVPD集合中每个帐户计算的平均共享概率计算出的值，该组所选MVPD在所选时间帧期间从所选程序员信道之一进行流式处理。

![](assets/sharing-level.png)


*图：共享级别*

趋势指示器显示指标值与上一个时间范围相比的百分比变化。

### 共享帐户的使用情况 {#usage-from-shared-accounts}

此量规指示在定义的段和时间段内，所有订阅者帐户的使用百分比来自共享帐户。 量规以0到100%的比例标记使用范围（从共享帐户）。 这些范围（名为“低”、“中”、“高”和“异常”）基于行业平均值。

您还可以看到趋势指示器，该指示器描述共享帐户的使用量与上一个时间范围相比上升或下降。

### 总体共享得分 {#overall-sharing-score}

总体共享得分由共享得分组成，包括“共享级别”和“来自共享帐户的z使用情况”。

它提供的价值旨在反映共享相对于行业的影响。 其目的类似于信用评分，用单个数字汇总情况。 但在本例中，数字越大，潜在危害就越大。

## Average sharing score - aggregated for the current segment {#aggregated-sharing}

The Aggregated Sharing Score panel provides a top line readout summarizing the quantity and impact of sharing in terms of accounts and streaming volume.

The values help you understand the magnitude of credential sharing by your subscribers, hence providing a measure of the need to act upon it.

![](assets/aggregate-sharing-score.png)


*Figure: Average sharing score panel - aggregated for the current segment*

The following three metrics are components of the Average Sharing Score.

### Sharing level {#sharing-level}

The sharing level gauge shows the percentage of all your subscriber accounts (in the defined segment) that are shared, during the selected time frame.  

A value calculated based on an average of the sharing probability computed for every account for the selected MVPD(s) that has streamed from a one of the selected programmer channels during the selected time frame.

![](assets/sharing-level.png)


*Figure: Sharing level*

The Trend indicator shows the percentage change in the value of the metric in from the previous time frame.

### Usage from shared accounts {#usage-from-shared-accounts}

This gauge indicates what percent of the usage of all the subscriber accounts is from the shared accounts for the defined segment and time period. The gauge marks the ranges of usage (from shared accounts) on the scale of 0 to 100%. These ranges (named Low, Medium, High, and Abnormal) are based on the industry average.

You can also see the Trend indicator, which depicts a rise or fall in the usage from shared accounts as compared to the previous time frame.

![](assets/usage-4mshared-accounts.png)


*Figure: Usage from shared accounts*

### Overall sharing score {#overall-sharing-score}

Overall sharing score is composite of sharing scores including "Sharing level" and "Usage from shared accounts".

It provides a value meant to reflect the relative impact of sharing when compared to the industry. Its purpose is similar to that of a credit score, summarizing the situation with a single number. But in this case, the higher the number the greater the potential harm.

## Accounts sharing probability distribution{#accounts-sharing-probab-dist}

This panel partitions accounts into ranges of sharing probability quintiles from very low (0-20%) to very high (80-100%).

Pie chart shows the proportions (in term of percentages) of user accounts in various sharing probability ranges. Whereas, column chart shows the absolute numbers of accounts in different probability ranges.

>[!NOTE]

>The column chart uses a logarithmic scale.

### Accounts over threshold in current segment {#acc-over-threshold-in-segment}

You can select a level of sharing probability, out of the following to view number and percentage of accounts above it:

* Over very low (0%-20%) probability

* Over low (20%-40%) probability

* Over moderate (40%-60%) probability

* Over high (60%-80%) probability

## Number of accounts and usage by sharing probability level {#number-of-accounts-usage-sharing-probability}

This panel provides tabular view of  accounts partitioned into ranges of sharing probability quintiles from very low (0-20%) to very high (80-100%) with each quintile's associated usage from shared accounts.
