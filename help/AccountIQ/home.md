# Account IQ概述 {#account-iq-overview}

流媒体服务用户的凭据共享是行业面临的一个重大且日益严重的问题。 此外，了解、识别凭据共享并对凭据共享执行操作是一个复杂的过程。 了解订阅者的使用行为并形成其活动的整体视图涉及到复杂性 — 例如，区分同一家庭内外成员之间的共享。 由于此挑战，流服务提供商可能会禁止采取行动来阻止凭据共享。

通常，视频流服务提供商了解共享其业务的风险和成本，但补救措施有限，例如阻止共享者或提供优惠。 但是，建议采用一种知情且有针对性的方法 — 这种方法使服务能够准确理解共享，并采用奖励良好观看行为并同时以业务增长为目标的策略。 </span>

Adobe Primetime帐户IQ使视频流服务能够了解订阅者使用模式并确定凭据共享。 通过利用Adobe专有的多层机器学习模型，深入分析每个用户留下的长期数据痕迹，流媒体服务可以更好地理解使用行为并识别证书共享。 此外，它允许通过与其他系统集成来采取行动，例如限制并发流或自定义优惠，并验证这些行动的影响 — 无论是鼓励合法观看行为还是增加订阅者和收入。

Account IQ提供了一些工具和功能，可用于衡量、管理和从凭据共享中获利。 通过报表、分析和功能板，可以探索数据以识别模式。 通过导出以及与Adobe和第三方系统（如营销活动管理、货币限制或订阅者注册）的集成来支持直接操作。 专门跟踪工具可衡量这些操作是否成功，以便对其进行更新或扩展。

<!-- Credential sharing is rampant and prevalent among subscribers in the video streaming industry. To add to it, understanding, identifying, and acting on password sharing is a complex process. There is complexity involved in understanding the subscriber usage behavior and developing a holistic view of viewer activity—for example, distinguishing sharing among members within the same household and outside. Due to this challenge, streaming service providers have inhibitions in acting against password sharing.

Generally, video streaming service providers consider password sharing as fatal for business and act strongly against it, by blocking the sharers. However, it is advised to follow a holistic approach that enables them to understand sharing accurately and adopt strategies to reward good viewing behavior and target business growth simultaneously.

Adobe Primetime Account IQ enables video streaming services understand the subscriber usage patterns and identify password sharing by analyzing usage behavior. Moreover, it validates the impact of applying actions to encourage legitimate viewing behavior while maximizing business ROI, eventually growing subscribers and revenue.

By deeply analyzing the long, winding trail of data left behind by each subscriber using Adobe's proprietary multi-layer machine learning model, customers can understand usage behavior and identify password sharing with a greater degree of certainty, use the insights to validate the impact of applying actions to encourage legitimate viewing behavior while maximizing business growth, eventually act on password sharing using validated tactics to improve viewer experience, growing subscribers and revenue (for e.g. converting sharers to paid subscribers, managing ad loads based on sharing behavior, rewarding good behavior with better viewer experience).

Account IQ is helps you understand usage patterns and identify password sharing by leveraging the Primetime Authentication  solution that processes a huge volume of TV Everywhere transactions. A proprietary multi-layer machine learning model trained by this real-world TVE data accurately characterizes usage patterns and helps video streaming services understand usage patterns and identify password sharing at an individual account level. Based on Adobe's customer experience management solutions, Account IQ enables video streaming services to effectively use their audience data to create actionable sharing profiles as well powers integrations with other Adobe Digital Experience and 3rd party solutions—for example, Adobe Primetime Concurrency Monitoring or Adobe Analytics—to enable understanding usage patterns, identify and act upon password sharing.


<!-- The widespread availability of video content and streaming services bring with it problem of account sharing; eventually leading to the loss of revenue by content providers. Account IQ helps TV Everywhere and VOD (video on demand) providers understand the risks to their revenue and business operations, and determine the most effective actions to take to mitigate the impacts of credential fraud. It helps these media companies (MVPDs, Programmers, and VOD providers) manage and uncover the instances of password sharing with a high level of confidence, enabling them deliver better business outcomes and provide better viewing experiences for subscribers.

To help media companies better understand the password sharing within their businesses, Primetime Account IQ determines **Password Sharing Risk Index** that rates every subscriber on their likelihood of sharing account credentials for subscription passwords, from very low to very high. Based on these calculations and the resulting indices, analytics are performed and visuals are generated for better understanding and interpretation of the account sharing behavior. Account IQ is a hosted web application, which you can access using your browser.

Account IQ assigns sharing scores to different subscriber accounts, so that the content providers (media companies, programmers, MVPDs, and VOD providers) can take informed decisions about subscriber accounts and check the illicit sharing.

Passwords are the main methods for viewers to authenticate, and there is a misconception that credential sharing is allowed. This idea makes illicit password sharing a common practice; necessitating the need for media companies to educate their viewers about permissible sharing and prevent illicit sharing.-->
