# 预授权 {#preuthorize-android}

>[!NOTE]

>此页面上的内容仅供参考。 使用此API需要来自Adobe的当前许可证。 不允许未经授权使用。

应用程序需要使用预授权API方法以获得一个或多个资源的预授权决定。 应使用Preauthorize API请求进行UI提示和/或内容筛选。 在授予用户访问指定资源的权限之前，必须发出实际的授权API请求。



在出现意外错误（例如，网络问题、MVPD授权端点不可用等）时 在Adobe Primetime身份验证服务处理预授权API请求时发生，作为预授权API响应结果的一部分，受影响资源将包含一个或多个分隔的错误信息。


## `public void preauthorize(PreauthorizeRequest request, AccessEnablerCallback<PreauthorizeResponse> callback);`


**描述：**

**可用性：** v3.6.0+

**参数：**

- *PreauthorizeRequest*：用于定义请求的生成器对象
- AccessEnablerCallback ：用于返回API响应的回调
- PreauthorizeResponse ：用于返回API响应内容的对象
